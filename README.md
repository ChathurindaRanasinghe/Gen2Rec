Gen2Rec is a **Generalized Framework for using Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommendation processes**. This framework enhances recommendation systems by delivering personalized, context-aware suggestions that adapt to user needs and engagement patterns, making recommendations more insightful and relevant.


## Key Features

- Generalizability across different categories.
- Explainable recommendations.
- Cross-domain recommendations.
- Data pre-processing with LLMs.
- Flexibility in model selection.
- User and contextual data integration.
- Better natural language understanding.
- Lower computational resource usage.
- Scalability and vendor independence.


## Background and Motivation 

Aims to overcome issues with existing systems such as:
- Require significant time and resources for model training.
- Limited capability in processing natural language.
- Less flexibility (need to change weights to modify behavior).
- Lower generalizability.

How Gen2Rec solves these challenges:
- Provides a generalized framework to create recommendation systems.
- Incorporates Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for more personalized, efficient recommendations.
